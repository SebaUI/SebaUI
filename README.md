Hi, I'm **Sebastián Zúñiga**, **[UI designer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dactrtr/)** and **[Illustrator](https://www.instagram.com/dactrtr.svg/)**, always looking for the new "tech kid on the block", researching to improve my work, or developing (I also like to **[code](https://github.com/dactrtr)**) new skills. I'm the serious looking funny guy at every place and the designer that is in the middle of the developers talking like one more of the pack.

**Hey!** wait, all that knowledge research is **useless if isn't shared**, that's why with one of my **[friends](http://www.arielcerda.com/)** we run a small group of **[Sketch](https://medium.com/sketchchile)** where we share tutorials and stuff so cool that sometimes seems to be **frozen**.

Actually based in **my room** (thanks Covid).

Previously at **[Mckinsey Chile](https://www.mckinsey.com/)** and **[DeNA Chile](https://dena.com/intl/)**
